## Project Description

This chess engine uses bitboards for efficient board representation and implements the negamax algorithm for AI decision-making. The project is written in Python and is intended to provide a foundation for further development and experimentation in chess programming.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-engine.git
   cd chess-engine
